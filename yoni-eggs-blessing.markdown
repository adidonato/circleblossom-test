# Blessing Yoni Eggs

## What are Yoni Eggs?

Those Little Eggs appeared in my life a few years ago while I was doing a World Trip to discover myself and exploring all around.
This new practice unlocked the deeper doors inside out, built trusting relationship with myself and allowed me to slowly become the woman of my dreams. It is a beautiful gift, a gentle healing to come home in your body of bliss and live your full power as embodiment of the Feminine Divine.

>Names such as Love Eggs, Yoni Eggs, Jade Eggs,  are gemstones or crystals which are carved and polished into egg shapes and inserted into the vagina.

It is estimated that women have been practicing with yoni eggs for over 5000 years, evolved from Ancient China. The secret practice has been kept secret and repressed until only recently, it has been taught to the Queen and Concubines of The Royal Palace and to select taoist practitioners.
Today, Modern Women have access to the Sacred Tool for their own health, to awaken sensuality and for the pleasure of themself and their lovers.
