# The Mother of Summer - Day 14 to 20

Many women pay attention on the ovulation phase when they want to become pregnant and not before. This phase is a pure and beautiful moment where your energy is peaking! Flowering! and you are stepping back into the world.

Nourish the creative, sensual and sexual energy.

### Physiology:
This is your Ovulation phase

An egg gets released from its follicle in your ovary and will survive for 12-24h. Estrogen and testosterone rise to the peak level and give you a boost of energy.

### Peak Abilities:
The world is yours, go discover it!

It is time to meet and share with people. You’ll be able to create connections and supportive relationships which are good for you.

All your senses are called, everything smells and tastes good and your eyes are more open to your true self!

Empathy and altruism are peaking. You are able to listen and understand the needs of people around you and they can feel it.

Caring for others and being supportive are your goals.

Everything is about giving and generosity and you will receive in return.

Your confidence and your beauty are rising, that’s why you attract people.

Don’t forget this amazing part: sexual drive is at its highest! Enjoy it! Oh wait! It does not mean you are not going to enjoy your sexuality in the other phases. You can own your sex bliss and active pleasure all the time, in any phase!

### Be aware:
As you are present for the others, don’t forget yourself.

You won’t solve the World’s problems in one week, there is no reason to feel guilty if you are not doing enough for the others. You are doing great!

You are following your intuition, avoid analysing and logical thinking.

Home is important for you at this time to recharge yourself, don’t spend time too far away from the people you love  whatever and wherever home is to you. Keep nourishing yourself.

**Keep in mind that this precious time is coming and leaving. Your energy is moving and it is an amazing gift.**

### Tips:
Enjoy your sociability and plan to visit your family, catch up with friends, organise business meetings. You will develop epic relationships. This is definitely the perfect time for long conversations with your friends where you are going to have deep mesmerizing talks. It feels so good!

The capacity of listening and the feeling of being listened to is delightful! This is real sharing going on right there.

As you will feel really confident and comfortable speaking and defending your needs it is a great opportunity to talk about your project and share it with the right people.

*What does it mean “share it with the right people?”
There is no need to share with someone who always answer negatively. Talk to someone you trust the judgement of and who will give you an honest answer and make you grow up.*

Why not asking for a promotion, going to a job interview, sharing new ideas.

Sensual and sexual feeling increases, it is time for a date or warm moment with your partner.

If you are trying to get pregnant, follow the flow and don’t program “making a baby time” as it will frustrate you. It will be more efficient to have a wonderful evening, a nice dinner, bath and healthy cuddle at your peak time rather than programming ten commitments in the week. Love is in the air, enjoy it.

Tell your feelings to the people you love.

It is good to start writing some good memories of the day and keeping them in a journal. I personally write my three top of the day, every morning on my bullet journal.
