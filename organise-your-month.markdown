# How to organise your month?

Your cycle is a powerful resource. Once you are aware of the optimum abilities you possess in each phase you are going to achieve the goals you desire.

Here you will find how to create pleasurable cycles, deep feminine nourishment and **leading life** from your Inner Woman with <span class="pink-font">The Circle Calendar.</span>

How do I take decisions in my life?

Trace a circle as the example I give you and do a circular calendar with your four phases included in.
Write all your events and deadlines on the side and simply put them in your calendar.

>Here it’s fun to play with your tasks and your abilities on when and where to put your events. Instead of choosing the first date coming, by knowing your mood and desire before, you will be able to put the exact event at the exact place and time.

<span class="under">example 1:</span> Kirsten is visiting me from New York and as we are both crazy about hammams and saunas where we can have some precious time together to talk and share while relaxing, she proposed me a few dates.
<br>*wed, july 19 - Thur, july 20 or Sat, july 22?*
<br>*WHAT DATE SHALL I CHOOSE?*
<br>**The answer is Sat, july 22!**


I’ll be in my menstruation phase where I do love slowing down and taking good care of myself, having a nice massage and relaxing. A hammam with my friend will be perfect for that time.

<span class="under">example 2:</span> Let’s pretend it is July 21st today and I just realised that by the end of the month I need to finish my taxes and send the payment to the government. It stresses me a lot.
<br>*WHEN IS THE OPTIMAL MOMENT TO DO IT?*
<br>*SHALL I START RIGHT NOW EVEN IF I FEEL REALLY TIRED?*
<br>**The answer is during the Pre-Ovulation Phase**

It requires some courage to postpone my tasks but by knowing the deadline which is during my pre-ovulation phase, where I’ll possess all the faculties to finish my taxes efficiently without spending hours on them and feeling bad, I am respecting my needs.

<span class="under">example 3:</span> A well known body painter is in Paris in a few weeks and will give a weekend workshop about creativity. Because he is really famous, he is proposing the exact same courses for two different weekends.
<br>*WHICH WEEKEND IS THE MOST INTERESTING FOR ME TO GO THERE?*
<br>*Weekend july 8 and 9 or weekend july 15 and 16?*
<br>**The answer is weekend july 15 and 16**

The Pre-Menstruation Phase is the highest for creativity. **We enchained** our phases and the distinction is not really defined. The weekend 15 and 16 comes straight after the Ovulation phase where I will be full of the good vibes of wanting to be with people and share with them a nice moment but I will also be in possession of my fullest creativity and will probably be able to connect with my art.

<span class="under">example 4:</span> My fiancee and I decided to buy a new house and we need to go to the bank. My banker proposed me three dates: july 5, 6 or 7.
<br>*WHICH DATE IS BEST TO EXPECT A GOOD LOAN WITH MY BANKER?*
<br>**The answer is july 7**

>The Ovulation Phase is the optimum moment to share your projects and talk with people. You are comfortable talking and exposing your strategy.

I hope these examples will help you understand how you can take control of your cycle and match your peak abilities to your life.
