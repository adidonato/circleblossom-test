Here is the beauty of yoni egg, with a proper care, they will last a lifetime!

Proper attention and care to oneâ€™s feminine hygiene is an absolute necessity prior to beginning this practice. Cleanliness of the vaginal canal and the eggs are equally important. Stone eggs should be boiled or cleaned every one to two weeks with a diluted vinegar solution (one tablespoon per quart of water) and allowed to dry for at least one hour; since the stone egg easily absorbs vaginal fluid and can be a culture for germs if permitted to remain wet. A stone egg should be boiled by bringing it to the boiling point, and then allowing it to cool down. Boiling the stone egg is necessary prior to its first use. After that, simply wash it with water after each time you use it.
        	A word of caution about using soap or detergent: some people are allergic to certain chemicals that are found in soap and detergent, especially when inserted into the channel where the membranes are very sensitive. Also, many women are unknowingly allergic to alcohol (isopropyl or rubbing type), therefore its use should be avoided for cleansing purposes.
