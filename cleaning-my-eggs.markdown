# Caring about my Yoni Egg

Here is the beauty of yoni eggs, with proper care, they will last a lifetime!

Stone Eggs are from Earth and have a story and a live energy. Once removed from earth, Yoni Eggs need to receive a cleansing for you to receive their full healing properties.
When you do receive an egg it is ideal to give it an initial cleansing to allow it to be at its highest vibration.

**Here are different ways of cleaning your Yoni Eggs to receive the most benefits.**

### Sea Salt Bath
Give your egg a bath of sea salt or baking soda with warm water.
Allow the stones to soak overnight and then rinse them with clear water.

Be careful to not boil the water as it can damage your stone.

For the lucky ones who live by the ocean: salt water can be directly brought from the beach in a jar or you can have a nice swim with your crystals and wash them directly in the water.

### Full Moon
This little ritual became my favorite cleansing.
the full moon is at its fullest and provides a nice and gentle bath to the stones while the earth’s feminine energy is peaking.
Place your Yoni Eggs outside overnight to bask in the full moon light. Simply leave them on a window in a safe place and pull them in before sun reaches its strength because some stones can actually fade in sunlight.
As the full moon energy is present before and after the peak time, you can also bury your eggs underground for three days (one day before the full moon, the full moon and one day after) and let the earth properties and the moon clean the eggs.

### Smudge Smoke
During Women Ceremony we use the smudge smoke as a method of cleansing. in a ritual, we purify our stones  while we connect to our authentic feminine roots and sacred womb.
I recommend to use dried sage bundles or palo santo sticks for their beautiful feminine and sacred properties.
Light the smudge stick, blow out any flames and pass your Yoni Eggs through the smoke. Turn, twist and roll the stones into your fingers and through the smoke as long as you feel it necessary.

### Natural Organic Unscented sensitive skin Soap
Take your Yoni Eggs under the shower and use your intimal soap to clean your eggs.

A word of caution about using soap: when inserted into the channel where the membranes are very sensitive, the soap can irritate. You can always use clear water to clean your eggs.

## How often to clean your Yoni Eggs?

Intuition goes a really long way with cleaning crystals and will be based a lot on how often you use them and the energetic work you did with them.

You can always clean your egg before and after your practice with clear water.

For a regular practice of 4/5 times a week, cleaning once or twice a month is perfect.

Notice that if you use your Yoni Eggs with your partner for making love, a cleanse after sex is necessary to let your lover’s energy goes out of your egg.
I will tell you more about men and Yoni Egg soon.
