# The Winter Wise Woman - Day 1 to 6

This phase is your bleeding phase.

The first day of bleeding is considered as the first day of the woman cycle as it is most easy to recognize.

### Physiology:
The progesterone in your body plunges which causes the endometrium to shed the old lining: your PERIOD!

### Peak Abilities:
During this week your energy is the lowest of the cycle. When welcomed and understood this time is one of the most powerful of your cycle. It is an hibernation period where you can go down deep into yourself and focus on your needs.

Here are some faculties nature offers us:

Intuition and clear mind are peaking.

You go to the essential and leave the trifle.

You are able to clear your doubts and look forward.

It is a safe space to rest the ego.

You are here and now and accept things as they are.

Creative imagination and new ideas come from nowhere.

### Be aware of:
It can be really tricky to stop the body and the mind against the gain of constant productivity.

It is important to rest during your meditative phase for both physical and mental vitality.

You have to give yourself permission to slow down first.

Pretty often this phase is denied and it can takes time to re-learn how to honor yourself.

Menstrual conditions like clotting pain, cramps, bad feeling are from not honoring your cycle and resting especially the first and second day of your period. It might not be possible to take a day off but try to introduce some quietness and breaks.

Do not start a project as you will be bored and tired after a short time and then could feel discouraged and doubt your ideas:, keep the ideas fresh for next week.

Social interactions are not your favorite: have some time for yourself.

Long working hours won’t be beneficial for your task to be achieved and for your well-being.

Avoid planning, learning and logical thinking.

**Keep in mind that this precious time is coming and leaving. Your energy is moving and it is an amazing gift.**

### Tips!
The priority for this week is to clear your calendar of big events, meetings, or brain focus operations.

Take as much sleep and rest as you need.

Enjoy a break as simple as it is!

Give the gym a break for a few days.

You may have brilliant ideas during this period as your mind is really clear and focused to your need. Write down the ideas on a notebook and take action during the Pre-Ovulation Phase where you will receive all the energy to organise, plan and act.

Drink more water than usual especially because the liver is working really hard. Warm water + slices of lemon are really good!

Give your body healthy food in a reasonable amount.

Try to connect with Nature as much as possible.

If you are familiar with any relaxation or meditation techniques, it is a fabulous moment to explore them.

It requires self-confidence to postpone a job if you have some dead-line but it will give you the best results. Trust yourself: the more you rest, the more energised and powerful you’ll be in the next days.
