          <h1 id="cherry-pick-your-first-yoni-egg">Cherry-pick your First Yoni Egg</h1>

          <p>Here we are beautifuls, if you are interested in the adventure, you probably have a lot of questions on how to choose your eggs.</p>

          <p>I have practiced eggs since years and I have a ton of them and I am still not bored as I am  discovering new sensations and acquiring new ones.
If it is your first introduction to yoni eggs you mind feel a bit overwhelmed and excited at the same time. I truly believe in full power of instinct and I will always recommend to follow your intuition but here are tips that you will maybe find useful when choosing your yoni eggs.</p>

          <h2 id="does-size-matter">Does size matter?</h2>
          <p>Well, let’s be honest! It does count!</p>

          <p>Usually eggs come in three sizes: Large; Medium and Small</p>

          <p><img src="/assets/images2/pic3.jpg" alt="pict" /></p>

          <p>I use all sizes of eggs depending on my needs, desire and phase of my cycle as my uterus col is not placed at the same point.</p>

          <p>Traditionally you start with a Large yoni egg and as the dexterity grows, you go down in size. The larger it is, the easier it is to feel the egg and for the muscles to grip it.</p>

          <p>Don’t worry, it is completely normal to feel impressed by the size the first times and it’s also possible to start from the medium one. Once you feel comfortable with the tool inside of your yoni you can always go back to the large egg and start to work on your sensations.</p>

          <p>After a month you will probably feel the need to go for a medium one.</p>

          <p><span class="pink-font">It is totally normal to not feel the egg at the beginning, don’t discourage yourself and take your time to relax and meet the yoni egg.
Keep in mind that you can always get back to one or the other size and enjoy the different feelings.</span></p>

          <p>Small size is also a good choice if you are advanced in your practice and want to experience new sensations.</p>

          <p>If you had a baby or went into menopause or simply you are not sure which size to choose, you might prefer a set of the three sizes and work your way up.</p>

          <p>This is important! Do not practice Yoni Eggs if you are pregnant or right after giving birth. Otherwise it is recommended to practice during postpartum for your pelvic muscle. Be sure to talk with your doctor, doula, midwife before you start and find the support you need.</p>

          <h2 id="what-stone-shall-i-use">What stone shall I use?</h2>
          <p>Choosing a crystal is my favorite part. Natural gemstones possess healing properties you can take advantage of for your physical, emotional, mental and energetic well-being. It is really fun to follow your intuition when choosing a stone.
In traditional taoist practice, three semiprecious stones have been used: The Jade Yoni Egg;  The Rose Quartz Yoni Egg and The Black Obsidian Yoni Egg</p>

          <h3 id="the-genuine-jade-egg">The Genuine Jade Egg</h3>
          <p><strong>The “Stone of Heaven”</strong></p>

          <p>The Jade Egg is certainly the most popular yoni egg and also a great gemstone for beginners. It is a strong healing stone beneficial for the health of the entire organism by infusing the womb space with vibrations while being gentle and protective. The Jade egg balances the yin-yang energy by clearing fluids in the cells and promotes the release of impurities.
We recommend Jade if you don’t know what to choose or if you are new to the practice for the following reasons:
The Jade is one of the most, heavy, hard and dense stones, which means it won’t break accidentally on the floor while you are learning the technique. Trust me, it could happen and it is okay!
The thermal conductivity of the Jade Egg is high which means your body doesn’t need to lose a lot of energy to adjust the correct temperature. Keep your Jade Egg in your hands for a few minutes after your practice and feel this warm and soft energy bathing you. .
Learning Egg-ercices or doing Kegel exercises with the Jade Egg is much easier as the weight of the stone allows you to feel the contractions of your muscles easily. Don’t worry if you don’t feel anything the first times! It’s totally normal!</p>

          <h3 id="the-lovely-rose-quartz">The Lovely Rose Quartz</h3>
          <p><strong>My favorite baby egg!</strong></p>

          <p>It is the mothering crystal which liberates and honors a soft feminine energy connected to the Heart Chakra. It carries a high spiritual attunement to Earth and provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment.
With its gentle rose essence, Rose Quartz procures the quintessence of Love, allowing the capacity to truly give and receive love from yourself and the others.
It is a powerful aphrodisiac, stimulates your imagination, develops your art creativity while bringing an envelope of love around you.
Rose Quartz soothing vibrations are a balm to the emotions, dissolving the barriers and blockages and gently nourishing your heart.
If you are in love with love and need to be surrounded by it, Rose Quartz is your new bonbon for your own sexy bliss.</p>

          <p>Check out The Lovely Rose Quartz Set</p>

          <h3 id="madame-black-obsidian">Madame Black Obsidian!</h3>
          <p><strong>When volcanic lava comes in contact with water!</strong></p>

          <p>Black Obsidian is a beautiful gift to have in your egg collection to work with the spirit world and attune yourself to the Inner Soul and Divine Feminine. It is a powerful ally and a strong protective stone which eliminates negative energies in oneself and one’s environment. If you want to travel deep inside, you will connect with the Root Chakra opened by herself.
Think, Madame is a strong sponge soaking up all your bad decisions, traumas, regrets and keeping you grounded and safe. Meditation with Black Obsidian allows for embracing higher and finer frequencies of light. It is beautiful!</p>

          <p>check out Madame Black Obsidian set</p>

          <p><span class="pink-font">
Important:  You will find online many types of exotic gemstones for cheap blowing prices; keep in mind that not every crystal is safe to be worn inside the vagina. After researching and testing, we are proud to propose yoni eggs that contain all the powerful elements of precious stones and a safe quality to be placed into your sacred space.
</span></p>

          <h3 id="the-blossom-crystal-set">The Blossom crystal set</h3>
          <p>This is the most popular set. This set of three eggs is ideal from a beginner, intermediate to advanced egg lover.
It is composed of the three traditional taoist stones: A large Jade Egg, a medium Rose Quartz Egg and a small Obsidian Egg to allow yourself to go deeper in your practice.</p>

          <h3 id="the-dream-circle-set">The Dream Circle Set</h3>
          <p>Choose three eggs of your choice Large, medium and small</p>

          <h2 id="drilled-or-undrilled-egg">Drilled or undrilled egg?</h2>
          <p>Drilled Yoni Eggs have a small hole drilled through the narrow end. You can choose to put a string as an unwaxed dental floss string through the hole which allows for easy retrieval of the egg. They also allow you to practice Kegel exercises to strengthen your perinea.
Undrilled Yoni Egg can be intimidating at first but when you will progress in your practice, you will want to try the “no string experience” and the beauty of trusting yourself and your body. The crystal will stay inside of you for as long as it needs and come out when the healing work is done.</p>

          <p><span class="pink-font">
We truly encourage you to trust your body, trust your intuition and let it go.
Yoni egg practice is not just a vagina series exercise, these eggs will assist you in your path of spiritual transformation.
</span></p>

          <p>Don’t worry the egg won’t get “lost”! There is no reason of harm in wearing the egg 24h or even longer and you can always  put it out for intercourse.
After a few weeks of practice, you’ll learn how to be able to push the egg out with your vagina muscles.</p>

          <p>We consciously choose to provide Drilled Eggs. The magic of drilled Yoni Eggs is that they can be used both with string or not as you don’t have to buy all your twin undrilled ones.</p>
