## The Priestess of Autumn - Day 21 to 28

This is the yin and yang phase. A remarkable cascade of hormonal events who give rise to varied possible emotions.

### Physiology:
Little by little estrogen and testosterone decline and your body starts producing progesterone.

### Peak Abilities:
Creativity and art are showing up: it is the best time to explore all your artistic desires.
You’ll feel genius ideas coming out of nowhere intuitively manifesting to you.
You are able to see the good and bad points on different projects and make a clear global vision of the things around you.
If there is any problem around you, you’ll be able to find the solution and solve it quickly.

### Be aware:
It might be a challenging phase as a lot of feelings and emotions can appear and disappear quickly. That’s why you need to focus on your need and listen to yourself while connecting to your feminine body.
Many women can experience pre-menstrual symptoms (PMS) and just as autumn arrives, we are invited to start to slow down and draw within. Self-care is the key.
Your energy level is constantly moving with peaks of high and low.
You can’t count on starting a big project as you’ll be bored pretty fast.
Mood swings are observed at that time, don’t be hard on yourself and the others.
Be aware of your critiques if they are not constructive. It hurts.
Don’t expect others to understand what you need, guide them, it is a win win.
**Keep in mind that this precious time is coming and leaving. Your energy is moving and it is an amazing gift. **

### Tips:
Your pre-menstrual phase is a wise guide. Here is the opportunity to become the alchemist of your own transformation and take it as the best medicine of your life.
Allowe your artistic and creative sense to flourish: go painting, drawing, singing, dancing, writing… everything you want to explore. .
As your energy is moving a lot in a day, you need to take a lot of small break to relax your mind and your body.
Every two hours, have a small 5 minutes break where you can walk, play music, do some automatic writing or coloring some mandala and let it go without any thinking or trying to produce something.  Your work will be much more efficient and you will control your emotions more easily.
Have always some water with you and  a little something to eat as you can experience low blood-sugar moments
It is time to take care of yourself: have a nice massage, a warm bath with nice candles and essentials oils, eat nourishing and comforting healthy food, read a nice book, find a place at home where you can be alone and relax yourself without perturbation, take a restorative class of yoga.
You may feel more tired sometimes, go to sleep one hour earlier you will feel the difference the next morning.
