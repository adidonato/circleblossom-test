## The Maiden of Spring - Day 7 to 13

Rise of energy phase

This is the coming out of hibernation time where you possess all the nutrients and the vitality for the new cycle ahead. Go take actions!

### Physiology:
Your body releases the FSH (Follicule Stimulating Hormone) which is maturing in the ovaries preparing for your ovulation time. Both testosterone and estrogen start to boost your energy.

### Peak abilities:
This week all new signs start. It is the perfect time to start and jump on new projects of any kind. Take actions on all the inspirations you had last week.

Your hormones start to boost your energy, your brain activity and your skills. You feel more powerful and confident and are willing to try new things and take some risks.

You are able to accumulate a lot of work during this phase and be very efficient and productive. Take advantage of this power and achieve the things you sometimes are not motivate for.

Discover your capacity to learn, analyze, think and plan clearly and fast. It is ideal to create strategy, statistics, reports and think about short-middle and long term plans.

You are an independent and strong woman.

Confidence is peaking, take this power and light on.

Accepting challenges will be your favorite. No problem!

Fight for what you think is right.

### Be aware:
Always, keep in mind how you could act with others specially with other women. You should be aware that you could interact with a woman in pre-menstruation or menstruation phase with not the same energy and ability as yours. Be flexible! Be patient!

You can feel frustrated due to a lack of answers, actions or mental stimulus. Don’t be too demanding or directive with people around you.

Inactivity and slowness could frustrate you, you need movement.

Empathy and supporting people on emotional level can be challenging.

Impatience

Being too much in your head thinking and organising can also have the opposite effect on you. Fresh air and movement will definitely help you get out of your head.

**Keep in mind that this precious time is coming and leaving. Your energy is moving and it is an amazing gift.**

### Tips:
Get out! and enjoy all the physical activities you love! You need movement! Your body and your mind can’t be bored locked at home. Follow your beautiful impulsivity!

Intellectual stimulation is your food, go get it! Explore, learn and create.

It is ideal to do the administrative things you hate doing because you will be really efficient. Do your account or taxes, plan a new trip, organise your office, do a spring cleaning. You’re a multi-task Wonder Woman! Take advantage of it!

You can do a lot of brainstorming and go straight to the point, big decisions are not a big deal for you!

If you plan on trying a new diet and start eating healthy, this time is ideal as you will have big motivation.

Don’t forget to thank yourself and note all your achievements: it always gives satisfaction to look at the tasks we accomplished.
