Here we are beautifuls, if you are interested on the adventure, you probably have a lot of questions on how to choose your eggs.

I have practiced eggs since years and I have tone of them and still not bored as discovering new sensations and acquires new ones.
If it is your first introduction to yoni eggs you mind feel a bit overwhelmed and excited at the same time. I truly believe in full power of instinct and I will  always recommended to follow your intuition but is there tips you will maybe find useful to choose your yoni eggs.

## Does size matter?
Well, let’s be honest! It does count!

Usually eggs come in three sizes: Large; Medium and Small

I use all size of eggs depending on my need, envy and phase of my cycle as my uterus col is not placed at the same point.
Traditionally you start with the Large and as the dexterity grows, you go down in size. The larger it is, the easier it is to feel the egg and for the muscles to grip it.
Don’t worry, it is completely normal to feel impressed by the size at first times and also great to start by the medium one. Once you feel comfortable with the tool inside of your yoni you can always go back to the large egg and start to work on your sensations. After a month you will probably feel the need to go for a medium one.
It is totally normal to don’t feel the egg at the beginning, don’t discourage yourself and take your time to relax and meet the yoni egg.
Keep in mind that you can always get back to one or the other size and enjoy the differents feelings.

If you had a baby or went to menopause or simply not sure which size to choose, you might prefer a set of the three sizes and work on your way.

This is important! Do not practice Yoni Egg if you are pregnant or right after childbirth. Otherwise it is recommended to practice during postpartum to muscle your pelvic. Be sure to talk with your doctor, doula, midwife before you start and find the support you need.

Small size is also a good choice if you are advanced in your practice and want to experience new sensations.


## What stone shall I use?
Choosing a crystal is my favorite part. Natural gemstones possesses healing qualities you can taking advantage for your physical, emotional, mental and energetic well-being. It is really fun follow your intuition when you choose a stone.
In traditional taoist practice, three semiprecious stones have been used: Nephrite Jade Yoni Egg; Black Obsidian Yoni Egg and Rose Quartz Yoni Egg.

### The Genuine Nephrite Jade Egg
The “Stone of Heaven”
The Nephrite Jade Egg is certainly the most popular yoni egg and also a great gemstone for beginner. It is a strong healing stone beneficial for the health of the entire organism by infusing the womb space with vibrations while being gentle and protective.  Nephrite Jade egg balances yin-yang energy by clearing fluids in the cells and promotes the release of impurities.
We recommend Nephrite Jade if you don’t know what to choose or if you are new in the practice for the following reasons:
Nephrite Jade is one of the most, heavy, hard and dense stone, which means it won’t break accidentally on the floor while you are learning the technic. Trust me, it could happens and it is okay!
The thermal conductivity of the Nephrite Jade is high which means your body doesn’t need to loose a lot of energy to adjust the correct temperature. You’ll see how it is so nice to keep your Jade Egg in your hands for a few minutes after you practice.
Learning Egg-ercices or doing Kegel exercices with a Nephrite Jade is much more easier as the weight of the stone allowed you to feel the contractions of your muscles easily. Don’t worry if you don’t feel anything at first times! Totally normal!


### The Lovely Rose Quartz,
my favorite baby egg!
It is the mothering crystal who liberates and honores a soft feminine energy connected to the Heart Chakra. It carries a high spiritual attunement to Earth and provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment.
With its gentle rose essence, Rose Quartz procures the quintessence of Love, allowing the capacity to truly give and receive love from yourself and the others.
It is a powerful aphrodisiac, stimulates your imagination, develops your art creativity while bringing an envelope of love around you.
Rose Quartz soothing vibrations are a balm to the emotions, dissolves the barriers and blockages and gently nourisshes your heart.
If you are in love with love and need to be surrounded by, Rose Quartz is your new bonbon for your own sexy bliss.

### Madame Black Obsidian!
When volcanic lave comes in contact with water!
Black Obsidian is a beautiful gift to have in your eggs collection for working with the spirit world and attune yourself to the Inner Soul and Divine Feminine. It is a powerfull ally and a strong protective stone who eliminates negative energies in oneself and ones environment. If you want to travel inside deeply, you will connect with the Root Chakra opened by herself.

After researching and testing, we are proud to propose yoni eggs who contain all the powerful elements of precious stones and a safe quality to be placed into your sacred space.

## Drilled or undrilled egg?
Drilled Yoni Eggs have a small hole drilled through the narrow end. You can choose to put a string as an unwaxed dental floss string through the hole which allows for easy retrieval of the egg.
We higly recommanded un-drilled eggs.
for hygiene reason, un-drilled are simply more easy to clean and purify and the global form provide more energy. It could be intimedating at first but while you avance in your practice, you’ll be really happy to have them. With undrilled egg you may not have the option to extract the egg but there is the beauty in this practice. The crystal will stay inside of you for as long as it needs and come out when the healing work is done.
We truly encourage you to trust your body, trust your intuition and let it go.
Yoni egg practice is not just vagina series exercices, those eggs will assist you on your path of spiritual transformation.
Letting go is one of the hardest thing for us, I promess the results will mezmerised you.
Don’t worry the egg won’t get “lost”! There is no reason of harm in wearing the egg 24h or even longer and you can always intercourse and put it out.
After few weeks of practice, you’ll learn how being able to push the egg out with your vagina muscles.
